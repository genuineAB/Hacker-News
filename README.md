# HACKER NEWS

Have you ever heard of Hacker News? It's a great source of tech-related news. They provide a public API at https://hackernews.api-docs.io.

This project's goal is to make a web app to make it easier to navigate the news.

## Installing Dependences

    1. Python 3.7 - Follow instructions to install the latest version of python for your platform in the python docs

   2. Virtual Environment - We recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organized. Instructions for setting up a virual environment for your platform can be found in the python docs

    3. PIP Dependencies - Once your virtual environment is setup and running, install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
    ```

## SETUP DATABASE
    The database used for this application is postgresql. With Postgres running, create a hacker_news database:

    ```
    CREATE DATABASE hacker_news

    ```

## RUN THE SERVER
    From within the ./src directory first ensure you are working using your created virtual environment.

To run the server, execute:
```
export FLASK_APP=flaskr
export FLASK_DEBUG=1
flask run

```


## API REFERENCE

### GETTING STARTED
    Base URL: At present this app can only be run locally and is not hosted as a base URL. The backend app is hosted at the default, http://127.0.0.1:5000/.

    Authentication: This version of the application does not require authentication or API keys



### ENDPOINTS

#### GET /news
    General:
        Returns a list of questions in the database.
        For documentation purpose, results are paginated in groups of 5. This can be adjsted to suit your use
